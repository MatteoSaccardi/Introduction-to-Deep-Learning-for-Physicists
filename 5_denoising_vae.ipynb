        "Just as a standard autoencoder, a variational autoencoder is an architecture composed of both an encoder and a decoder and that is trained to minimise the reconstruction error between the encoded-decoded data and the initial data. However, in order to introduce some regularisation of the latent space, we proceed to a slight modification of the encoding-decoding process: instead of encoding an input as a single point, we encode it as a distribution over the latent space. The model is then trained as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* first, the input is encoded as distribution over the latent space\n",
        "* second, a point from the latent space is sampled from that distribution\n",
        "* third, the sampled point is decoded and the reconstruction error can be computed\n",
        "* finally, the reconstruction error is backpropagated through the network\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, the encoded distributions are chosen to be normal so that the encoder can be trained to return the mean and the covariance matrix that describe these Gaussians. The reason why an input is encoded as a distribution with some variance instead of a single point is that it makes possible to express very naturally the latent space regularisation: the distributions returned by the encoder are enforced to be close to a standard normal distribution. We will see in the next subsection that we ensure this way both a local and global regularisation of the latent space (local because of the variance control and global because of the mean control).\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, the loss function that is minimised when training a VAE is composed of a \n",
        "\n",
        "* ***reconstruction term*** (on the final layer), that tends to make the encoding-decoding scheme as performant as possible;\n",
        "* ***regularisation term*** (on the latent layer), that tends to regularise the organisation of the latent space by making the distributions returned by the encoder close to a standard normal distribution. Without this term, VAE will act like a basic autoencoder, which may lead to overfitting, and we won’t have the generative properties that we desire."

        "The overall architecture is then obtained by concatenating the encoder and the decoder parts. However we still need to be very careful about the way we sample from the distribution returned by the encoder during the training. The sampling process has to be expressed in a way that allows the error to be backpropagated through the network. A simple trick, called ***reparametrisation trick***, is used to make the gradient descent possible despite the random sampling that occurs halfway of the architecture and consists in using the fact that if z is a random variable following a Gaussian distribution with mean $m(x)$ and with covariance $s(x)$. Then it can be expressed as:\n",
